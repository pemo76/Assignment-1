1.) Find the time complexity for the following scenarios
    a.)        for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
                      for(j=i;i<=n;j++)
                               printf("Hi");

ans----          In this case,there are two loops.For 1st case the lopp will be going first and after that 2nd loop  
                      started.For i=1,the 2nd loop count "Hi" in nth time 
                                      For i=2,the 2nd loop count "Hi" in nth time
                                      For i=2,the 2nd loop count "Hi" in nth time
                                                                               .
                                                                               .
                                                                               .
                                                                               .
                                     For i=n,the 2nd loop count "Hi" in nth time
       so,  n*n=n^2.
      The time complexity for this case = o(n^2).
 

   b.)      for(i=1;i<=n;i*=3)
                   for(j=1;i<=n;j++)
                            printf("Hello");

ans-----       Time complexity = o(nlogn).
